	"bio": "Greg Kappes (b. 1994) is a composer, improvisor, creative coder, and multimedia artist based in Berlin, DE.<br><br>Kappes has constructed complex software instruments for improvisation, choreographed networks of sound-emitting cellphones, and interactive, expressive (and mostly functional) AI’s. Concerned with topics such as data, mediation, and interface, these works question the machine’s role in our society (friend or foe, tool or collaborator) and highlight the intimate relationships we build with and through our beloved processing units. Each work is conceived as a collaboration with a new material or technique with the aim of letting the material guide the creative process in a sort of feedback loop. In the face of tech-aided surveillance and profiteering, these works aim to recuperate these often strained relationships by facilitating novel interaction, play, and connection. In his improvisation practice, he works largely with electronics, custom software, and the prepared piano. He is concerned with experimental forms, blurring genre distinctions, and reconciling a penchant for lush polyharmonic landscapes with a more minimalist emphasis on interlocking rhythms and sparse textures. In his work with electronics, he examines the role of technology as collaborator and the effect of the medium on the finished work; he is especially interested in the limits and distinct qualities of digital media.<br><br>Greg has had works performed at the FEASt FEST, the Center for New Music (San Francisco), Spektrum (Berlin), and the California Electronic Music Exchange Concerts at UCSB, UCSC, Stanford and Mills College. He has also exhibited installation works at Slide Space 123 at Mills College and at the Signal Flow Festival. He has studied with Roscoe Mitchell, Maggi Payne, Zeena Parkins, James Fei, John Bischoff, Chris Brown, and Anna Weesner.<br><br>"
