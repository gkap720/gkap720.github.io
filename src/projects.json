			"description": "The website allows potential audience members to get detailed information about the Signal Flow festival and draws them in with an attractive UI and a floating music player which is functional in every part of the site. I built the website from the ground up and incorporated custom animations to align with the graphic design work by Seiyoung Jang. I was able to make a reactive, welcoming website while also meaningfully incorporating contributions of collaborators. You can visit the site [here](https://archive-2018.signal-flow.org).",

			"description": "pls don't(!) silence ur cellphones is a multimedia performance which uses a web app to coordinate movement between a large audience. The work also makes extensive use of the WebAudio API to produce an immersive experience using only the audience members' cellphone speakers. The UI is a minimal single-page app which communicates directions to the audience in a direct and easy-to-read manner.",

			"description": "netwreckerzzz is a network music piece using a web app as the centerpiece of the experience. Developed and composed in collaboration with Alexander Dubovoy, the piece brings the audience into the work by allowing the spectators to directly participate through surveys sent to their phones. The audience's responses then influence a visualizer created using p5.js which is interpreted as a score by an acoustic ensemble. The audience's cellphone speakers are also used to make sound using the WebAudio API. You can find the code [here](https://github.com/ajdubovoy/homewreckerzzz).",
