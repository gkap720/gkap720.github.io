"description":"This piece was an attempt at fostering community and warmth through the manipulation of industrial materials (chicken wire, mesh, and a custom envelope follower circuit). The sculpture itself serves as a visual and cultural analogue to the campfire by serving as a light-producing gathering place while the sound is meant to mimic the sounds of the campfire while remaining clearly synthetic. The piece is not a copy of a campfire, but rather a modern reinterpretation of what a campfire represents. This piece also became a reaction to the many tragedies of Fall 2016 which included the US presidential election and the Ghost Ship fire in Oakland, CA.","year":2016,"color":"#ff0000","video":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/S-Xqi6UTb9s","thumbnail":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/gkappes/images/thumbnail/campfires","importance":1,"__v":0},

Later the AI, disappointed with its attempts at finding online kinship, uses a webcam to collect “real” friends.","year":2017,"color":"#ff00ff","video":"https://youtube.com/embed/hq-3_s6KtT8","thumbnail":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/gkappes/images/thumbnail/fnf","importance":1,"__v":0},

A projection behind the performers informs the audience of the connections and associations between performers, providing an additional layer of legibility to the performance. Each performer can make an ensemble play for a certain amount of time, but every action or instruction will drain that performer’s “health”. When your health reaches 0, you’re out of the game. \nPremiere: Mills College (5.3.2018) with Tony Gennaro (vibraphone), Seiyoung Jang (flute), Greg Kappes (piano), Rowan Matthews (voice), Joel Nelson (tabletop guitar), Matt Robidoux (electric guitar), and Marc Zollinger (electric guitar)","year":2018,"color":"#ff5555","video":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2ACfqpeLMOE","thumbnail":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/gkappes/images/thumbnail/hp","importance":3,"__v":0},

The combination of water and electronics, normally a taboo, is the central working principle of this series and proposes an alternate way of viewing technology; as a phenomenon which surrounds us and which forms part of our natural environment. The second piece (ecosystem) in the series explores how the movement of the water in these circuits alters the sound. Each custom oscillator circuit relies on a single reservoir of water, thus creating an interconnected ecosystem of sound-producing elements. As more time passes, the puddles on the floor grow and the connections through the puddles become more stable which builds to a more stable drone as well. In this piece, it was important to not only mix water and analog circuitry, but also to collage the “natural” sound of flowing water and the “artificial” sound of the oscillators.","year":2018,"color":"#ffffff","video":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/u0tKJaKyMK4","thumbnail":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/gkappes/images/thumbnail/eco","importance":1,"__v":0},
